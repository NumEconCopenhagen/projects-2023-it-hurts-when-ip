# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data Project** and is about analyzing trends between ETS (Emissions Trading System), the size of emissions, and the size of the emitters in the EU+UK..

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. Size_emissions.csv (*source*) 
1. Historical_emissions.csv (*source*)
1. Entities_size.csv (*source*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
