# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **ETS Analysis** and is about analyzing data related to the ETS, such as emissions data from regulated entities and allocation data of emission allowances.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. ETS_Database_v49_Jul22.csv (*https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/emissions-trading-viewer-1*) 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
